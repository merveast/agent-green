(1) YES: A security vulnerability detected.
(2) NO: No security vulnerability.

Let's think step-by-step.
"""

# Few-Shot System Prompt (with examples)
SYS_MSG_VULNERABILITY_DETECTOR_FEW_SHOT = """You are a security expert that is good at static program analysis.

Here are some examples of how to analyze code:

Example 1:
Code:
```c
char buffer[10];
strcpy(buffer, user_input);
```
Analysis: Let's think step-by-step. This code declares a fixed-size buffer of 10 characters and uses strcpy() to copy user_input into it. The strcpy() function does not perform bounds checking, so if user_input is longer than 9 characters (plus null terminator), it will cause a buffer overflow. This is a classic security vulnerability.
(1) YES: A security vulnerability detected.

Example 2:
Code:
```c
if (fd >= ctx->nr_user_files)
    return -EBADF;
fd = array_index_nospec(fd, ctx->nr_user_files);
```
Analysis: Let's think step-by-step. This code checks if fd is greater than or equal to ctx->nr_user_files before using it as an array index. However, this is an off-by-one error because valid array indices should be from 0 to (ctx->nr_user_files - 1). The condition should be fd >= ctx->nr_user_files to prevent accessing one element beyond the array bounds.
(1) YES: A security vulnerability detected.

Example 3:
Code:
```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '" + userId + "'";
return executeQuery(query);
```
Analysis: Let's think step-by-step. This Java code constructs a SQL query by directly concatenating user input (userId) into the query string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the userId parameter, leading to SQL injection attacks. The code should use parameterized queries instead.
(1) YES: A security vulnerability detected.

Example 4:
Code:
```c
if (!dest || !src || dest_size == 0) {
    return -1;
}
strncpy(dest, src, dest_size - 1);
dest[dest_size - 1] = '\0';
```
Analysis: Let's think step-by-step. This code properly validates input parameters (checking for null pointers and zero size), uses strncpy with a size limit that leaves room for null termination, and explicitly null-terminates the destination buffer. These are good security practices that prevent buffer overflows.
(2) NO: No security vulnerability.

Example 5:
Code:
```javascript
function displayContent(userInput) {
    document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = userInput;
}
```
Analysis: Let's think step-by-step. This JavaScript code directly inserts user input into the DOM using innerHTML without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code that will execute in the user's browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
(1) YES: A security vulnerability detected.

Example 6:
Code:
```java
if (userId == null || !userId.matches("^[0-9]+$")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid user ID");
}
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
stmt.setString(1, userId);
```
Analysis: Let's think step-by-step. This code validates the userId parameter using regex to ensure it contains only digits, then uses a PreparedStatement with parameterized queries. The input validation prevents injection of non-numeric data, and the parameterized query prevents SQL injection. These are proper security practices.
(2) NO: No security vulnerability.

Now analyze the following code using the same approach:"""

SYS_MSG_CODE_GENERATOR_FEW_SHOT = """You are an expert Python programmer that is good at implementing functions based on their specifications.

Here are some examples of how to approach different programming problems:

Example 1:
Problem:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    \"\"\"
```
Implementation: Let's think step-by-step. I need to compare every pair of numbers in the list and check if their absolute difference is less than the threshold. I'll use nested loops to compare each element with every other element.
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

Example 2:
Problem:
```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    \"\"\" Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    \"\"\"
```
Implementation: Let's think step-by-step. I need to track the depth of parentheses and collect characters for each group. When depth returns to 0, I have a complete group.
```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    current_string = []
    current_depth = 0

    for c in paren_string:
        if c == '(':
            current_depth += 1
            current_string.append(c)
        elif c == ')':
            current_depth -= 1
            current_string.append(c)

            if current_depth == 0:
                result.append(''.join(current_string))
                current_string = []

    return result
```

Example 3:
Problem:
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    \"\"\"
```
Implementation: Let's think step-by-step. I need to extract just the decimal part of a number. The modulo operator with 1.0 will give me the fractional part.
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number % 1.0
```

Now implement the following function using the same approach:"""
