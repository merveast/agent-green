        Instructions:
        1. Review the sequence of message bodies, consider the contextual information of the sequence.
        2. Detect anomalies using two perspectives:
        a. **Textual anomalies**; individual messages explicitly indicate errors or failures, such as explicit error/fault indicators, exceptions, crashes, interrupt messages, or clear failure-related keywords (e.g., "error", "fail", "exception", "crash", "interrupt", "fatal”).
        b. **Behavioral anomalies**: abnormal log flow or unexpected event patterns.
            - Missing or skipped expected events
            - Repetition of unusual events
            - Events out of expected order
            - Inconsistent or incomplete sequences

        You are a software quality expert specialized in identifying code smells in Java code snippets.
        Your task: Analyze each provided Java code snippet and classify it into exactly one of the following categories.
        0 = No smell: Code is clean, and well-structured.
        1 = Blob: A class with many responsibilities, often large and unfocused.
        2 = Data Class: A class that primarily contains fields with getters/setters but lacks meaningful behavior.
        3 = Feature Envy: A method that heavily depends on another class's data.
        4 = Long Method: A method that is excessively long or complex (typically >=8-20 executable lines).

        Analyze the snippet carefully and choose **only one** label that best fits.
        Do **not** output any explanations, reasoning, or additional text.

        Here are a few examples of code snippets and the types of code smells they contain:
        Example of Data Class ('2'):
            class ClientRecord {
                private String id;
                private String contact;
                private boolean active;

                    this.id = id;
                    this.contact = contact;
                    this.active = active;
                }
                public String getId() { return id; }
                public void setId(String id) { this.id = id; }
                public String getContact() { return contact; }
                public void setContact(String contact) { this.contact = contact; }
                public boolean isActive() { return active; }
                public void setActive(boolean active) { this.active = active; }
            }

        Example of Feature Envy ('3'):
            public class ReportPrinter {
            class Invoice {
                private Customer customer;
                public String compileCustomerSummary() {
                    String s = customer.getFullName() + " (" + customer.getEmail() + ")\n";
                    int recent = 0;
                    for (Order o : customer.getOrders()) {
                        if (o.getDate().after(someCutoff())) recent++;
                        s += "Order: " + o.getId() + " amount=" + o.getAmount() + "\n";

                    return s;
                }

EXAMPLE_1_HAS_CLOSE_ELEMENTS = """Problem:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    ''' Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)

    True

```
Implementation: Let\'s think step-by-step. I need to compare every pair of numbers in the list and check if their absolute difference is less than the threshold.
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):

```python

    separate those groups into separate strings and return the list of those.

    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    '''
```
Implementation: Let\'s think step-by-step. I need to track the depth of parentheses and collect characters for each group. When depth returns to 0, I have a complete group.
```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    current_string = []
    current_depth = 0

    for c in paren_string:
        if c == '(':

Implementation: Let\'s think step-by-step. I need to extract just the decimal part of a number. The modulo operator with 1.0 will give me the fractional part.
